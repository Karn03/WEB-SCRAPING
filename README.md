# Web Scraping using AI

## Overview
This repository contains an advanced web scraping framework that leverages AI techniques to extract, process, and analyze data from the web efficiently. The project integrates traditional web scraping methods with machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to enhance data extraction, filtering, and structuring.

## Features
- **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: Uses machine learning models to extract relevant information from unstructured web data.
- **NLP for Content Analysis**: Implements NLP techniques for text summarization, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER).
- **Automated Scraping with Selenium & BeautifulSoup**: Combines Selenium for dynamic content and BeautifulSoup for parsing.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Utilizes AI-driven techniques to remove noise and improve data quality.
- **Cloud Storage & API Integration**: Supports saving scraped data to cloud storage (AWS, GCP) and integrating APIs for real-time data processing.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Selenium & BeautifulSoup** for web scraping
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn & TensorFlow** for AI/ML models
- **NLTK & SpaCy** for NLP tasks
- **Flask/Django** for API integration

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/web-scraping-ai.git
cd web-scraping-ai

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Set up configuration**: Modify `config.json` with target website URLs and parameters.
2. **Run Scraper**: Execute the main script to start scraping.
   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```
3. **Process Data**: Run AI-powered analysis on scraped data.
   ```bash
   python analyze.py
   ```
4. **Deploy API (Optional)**: Use Flask/Django for serving data via REST API.
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Example Output
Example structured data extracted using AI techniques:
```json
{
  "title": "Latest AI Trends in 2025",
  "author": "John Doe",
  "sentiment": "Positive",
  "summary": "AI is revolutionizing multiple industries with new advancements..."
}
```

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate **GPT-based models** for content generation and summarization.
- Enhance **automation** with task scheduling and cloud deployment.
- Improve **anti-bot evasion techniques** for more resilient scraping.
